**##Enough of that!**

I also enjoy watching movies, I've recently been watching the James Bond films from *Dr. No* to *Spectre* in preparation for the new one coming up in October. My top five films of this series are (in order):
1. Goldfinger
2. From Russia with Love
3. A License to Kill
4. Goldeneye
5. Skyfall

The series as a whole I think is very enjoyable and I'm surprised how far it's gone in terms of production and its influence on other movies. For example, there have been a lot of twists on the phrase:
> Bond. James Bond

**##Finale**

I do not have much experience coding outside of school. I've never had an internship nor have I tried to code in my free time, however, I am pretty excited about working in an environment that will be similar to work in real life with teams and all that. In this lab, I found it kind of awkward using the `git commit` and `git push` commands, maybe because I don't have that much experience with git commands. But, I feel like these commands especially were weird because I would've just exepected the changes on the files to be automatically reflected on the main repository in github. Also, for a moment I thought I had lost my [.gitignore](.gitignore) file in the third branch for part 2. Anyways, I hope this quarter goes well.
